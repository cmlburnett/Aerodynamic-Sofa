Aerodynamic Sofa
Synchronizes the entirety of a Flickr account to the local computer for backup.

PURPOSE
The purpose and goal of Aerodynamic Sofa is to create a full copy of all
metadata locally that mirrors what is on Flickr.  I actually created this prior
to the February 2011 incident where Flickr nuked an active account (bindermichi)
accidentally and mostly for reasons that came true for Mirco.  It also makes me
feel warm and fuzzy knowing the countless hours I have tagged, entitled,
described, noted, located, cataloged (sets, etc.), etc. have a nice, pretty
backup on my own computer.

This backup should be sufficiently robust that recreating my Flickr account
would be doable, though not necessarily easy, but doable nonetheless.


SYNCHRONIZATION
There are eight things that can be synchronized from Flickr:
* Collections
* Favorites
* Galleries
* Photos
* Groups
* Sets
* Contacts
* Profile

Each of these is stored in an XML file like the following for contacts and profile:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<asofa>
    <contacts>
        <contact nsid="24662369@N07" realname="NASA Goddard Space Flight Center" username="NASA Goddard Photo and Video" family="0" friend="0" ignored="0" />
    </contacts>
</asofa>

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<asofa>
    <profile nsid="11111111@N01" username="upload" realname="Bob">
